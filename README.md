# Blackjack
Getting to learn C++ by making a command line Blackjack game. Updates the console with card suits/ranks and hand totals. Takes into 
account standard Blackjack rules, like the dealer having to hit while below 17, and Ace cards counting as `1` or `11`. 
**blackjack.cpp** was a first attempt at making the game using what I learned after my first C++ college course. 
**blackjackClass.cpp** was my second attempt, by trying to implement Classes and vectors.
